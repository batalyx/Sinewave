It is hard to find a simple example of how to play a synthesized
sound on macOS without any third party libraries.  I suppose there
are several other ways, but I present here a quite simple one.
One would hope that there was a simple routine for just playing
an array of floats, but no, there's none.  I hope this example
makes it quite easy to play such an array.
